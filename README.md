## ESLint Configuration
Brightlayer UI has developed a custom ESLint configuration file that is used throughout Brightlayer UI. This package extends ESLint recommended settings with some specific modifications selected by the Brightlayer UI team. You can read more [here](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-code-standards/tree/dev/eslint-config).

## Prettier Configuration / Editor Configuration
The Brightlayer UI prettier configuration and editor configuration files are used to maintain consistent coding style across Brightlayer UI applications. This package extends the recommended settings with some minor adjustments for team preferences. You can read more [here](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-code-standards/tree/dev/prettier-config).
